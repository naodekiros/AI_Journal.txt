Week 1:
  Sorry in advance but I do not have any saved chats with ai websites because I did not know we had to but I can talk about how I have used Ai this week. When downloading VS code for this class I was having some trouble
getting it on my computer so I had Chat gpt guide me on a step by step process on how to work through my issue. I dont know if talking about ai use has to retain to class but a fun way I used AI this week was putting in
a bunch of resturants and having it choose which place to doordash from.

Week 2: I had trouble with question 28 on our assignment this week so I tried using Ai to figure it out but still could not. Outside of that I did not use ai at all for many things outside of trying to figure out what the best shampoo/conditioner for my hairtype was lol. I do like this assignment though. Not many opprotunites to just write, its really refreshing.

Week 3: I used Ai on 2 of the questions for the weekly assignments and on an ssignment for math because if im being honest, im not the best at it so extra help never hurts. Outside of that I used ai when I played blackjack this weekend to figure out a rule dispute me and one of my buddies had. Other than that I did not use much Ai throughout the duration of the week
